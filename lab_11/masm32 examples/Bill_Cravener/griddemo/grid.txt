Here is a simple method to grid a bitmap. It uses two memory
device contexts, one to hold the original bitmap and the other
as a workspace for holding a copy of the bitmap which the grid
is painted on. The workspace dc is then copied to the windows dc.

Each grid square equals one bitmap pixel and by changing the
value "xyZoomFactor" you can zoom the grid demo in or out.
