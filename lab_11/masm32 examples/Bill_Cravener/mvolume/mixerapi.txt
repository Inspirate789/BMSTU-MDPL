Here is an example of using Windows mixer API's. This example enables
you to easily add a master volume control to your program. There are
two examples on how to use the DLL and LIB files. The minimum value you
can send to the mixer is "0" the maximum is "65535", "0" being no sound
and "65535" being maximum volume.

I have tested these examples on a variety of different machines running
Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000 and XP. Of course you must have a sound card
installed on you computer for this master volume example to work. 

Windows mixer API's give you a way to make adjustments to the settings
of most any sound card without needing to be specifically written for that
card. Just like with other devices in order to use a mixer device you must
first open it with mixerOpen and then you may call other mixer API's to
control the sound card's input and output lines. When finished you must
close the device with mixerClose.
