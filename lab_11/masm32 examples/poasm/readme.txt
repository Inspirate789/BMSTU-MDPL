The examples in the POASM directory are designed to be built using Pelle's
Macro Assembler (POASM).

It is recommended that if you are interested in using POASM as a freestanding
assembler that you download the complete Pelles C package from the following URL.

http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc/

This will give you the complete Pelles C package complete with its own IDE,
documentation and tools. The IDE also contains a very good resource editor.

POASM is very similar to the syntax used in MASM but it is not a clone. For
programmers who want to write software that MASM is not licenced to write,
POASM is a good choice in that it is a powerful tool licenced to be used in
any environment without restriction.

Pelles tools are included in the masm32 project with his permission and are not
redistributable from the masm32 project.

If you wish to distribute POASM or any of Pelle's tools, contact Pelle Orinius
at the above URL to obtain his permission.
